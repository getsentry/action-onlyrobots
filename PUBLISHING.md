# Publishing Workflow

This document describes how to publish new versions of the Only Robots GitHub Action.

## Overview

The action follows semantic versioning and uses a multi-tag system similar to other popular GitHub Actions:

- **Specific version tags**: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v1.1.1` (immutable, points to exact commit)
- **Major version tags**: `v1`, `v2`, `v3` (mutable, points to latest release within major version)

## Publishing Process

### 1. Automated Publishing (Recommended)

The automated publishing workflow is triggered when you create a GitHub release:

#### Option A: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended for developers)

```bash
# Create a new release with auto-generated notes
gh release create v1.0.0 --title "v1.0.0 - Release Title" --generate-notes

# Or create with custom notes
gh release create v1.0.0 --title "v1.0.0 - Release Title" --notes "Custom release notes here"

# Or create with notes from a file
gh release create v1.0.0 --title "v1.0.0 - Release Title" --notes-file CHANGELOG.md
```

#### Option B: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. **Create a GitHub Release**:
   - Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/dcramer/action-onlyrobots/releases)
   - Click "Create a new release"
   - Tag version: `v1.0.0` (use semantic versioning)
   - Generate release notes or write them manually
   - Click "Publish release"

2. **Automatic Processing**:
   - The `release.yml` workflow will automatically:
     - Build the action
     - Run tests and linting
     - Update package.json version
     - Commit built files to the release tag
     - Update the major version tag (e.g., `v1` â†’ `v1.0.0`)

### 2. Manual Version Tag Updates

If you need to manually update a major version tag to point to a different release:

1. Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/dcramer/action-onlyrobots/actions)
2. Select "Update Version Tag" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter:
   - **Target**: The existing tag to point to (e.g., `v1.0.1`)
   - **Major version**: The major version to update (e.g., `v1`)

## Workflow Files

### `.github/workflows/check-dist.yml`
- Runs on push/PR to main
- Ensures compiled `dist/` directory is up-to-date
- Prevents merging code without proper build artifacts

### `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Runs when a GitHub release is published
- Builds, tests, and publishes the action
- Updates major version tags automatically

### `.github/workflows/update-version.yml`
- Manual workflow for updating major version tags
- Useful for hotfixes or corrections

## Pre-Release Checklist

Before creating a release:

1. **Ensure all changes are merged to main**
2. **Run local validation**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run validate
   ```
3. **Test the action locally**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run test-pr
   ```
4. **Verify dist/ is up-to-date**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   git status  # should show no changes in dist/
   ```

## Version Strategy

### Major Versions (v1, v2, v3)
- Breaking changes
- New required inputs
- Removed functionality
- Major workflow changes

### Minor Versions (v1.1, v1.2)
- New features
- New optional inputs
- Enhanced functionality
- Non-breaking changes

### Patch Versions (v1.1.1, v1.1.2)
- Bug fixes
- Security patches
- Documentation updates
- Performance improvements

## User Consumption

Users can reference the action in multiple ways:

```yaml
# Recommended: Use major version (gets latest patches automatically)
- uses: dcramer/action-onlyrobots@v1

# Specific version (locked to exact release)
- uses: dcramer/action-onlyrobots@v1.0.0

# Development version (not recommended for production)
- uses: dcramer/action-onlyrobots@main
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Artifacts Out of Date
If the `check-dist.yml` workflow fails:
```bash
pnpm run build
git add dist/
git commit -m "Update build artifacts"
```

### Release Workflow Fails
1. Check that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in repository secrets
2. Verify the tag follows semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
3. Ensure all tests pass locally with `pnpm run test`

### Major Version Tag Issues
If a major version tag points to the wrong release:
1. Use the "Update Version Tag" workflow
2. Or manually update via CLI:
   ```bash
   git tag -f v1 v1.0.1
   git push origin v1 --force
   ```

## Security Notes

- Only repository maintainers can create releases
- All builds are performed in GitHub Actions (not local machines)
- Secrets are only accessible to the release workflow
- Built artifacts are committed to release tags, not main branch
