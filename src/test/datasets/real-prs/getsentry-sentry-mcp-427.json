The `getAuthenticatedUser` method now:\n\n- For SaaS instances: Always routes to `sentry.io` regardless of the configured regional host\n- For self-hosted instances: Continues using the configured host\n\nThis resolves the error occurring in the search-issues tool when it attempts to resolve \"me\" references in queries.\n\nFixes [MCP-SERVER-ED5](https://sentry.sentry.io/issues/6764095138/)",

      "fix: resolve OpenAI structured outputs validation error in search_issues tool\n\n- Remove .default(false) from includeExamples parameter in discover-dataset-fields\n- Change optional fields to nullable in IssueQuerySchema for OpenAI compatibility\n- Add error cause preservation for better debugging\n- Simplify evaluation tests to focus on core behaviors",
      "fix: resolve 404 error for /auth/ endpoint on regional hosts\n\nThe /auth/ endpoint only exists on the main Sentry API server (sentry.io), not on regional endpoints like us.sentry.io. This fix ensures that authentication requests are always routed to the correct host.\n\nFor SaaS instances, the getAuthenticatedUser method now explicitly uses sentry.io instead of regional hosts. Self-hosted instances continue to use their configured host.\n\nFixes MCP-SERVER-ED5",
      "fix: remove broken search-issues-agent eval test\n\nThe test was importing internal modules that aren't exported by the package,\ncausing CI failures. This eval should be restructured to match the pattern\nof other eval tests if needed in the future."
