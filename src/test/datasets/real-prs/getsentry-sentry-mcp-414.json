  "title": "fix: add SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN to deploy workflow for sourcemap uploads",
  "description": "## Summary\n- Fixes sourcemap upload to Sentry during production builds by adding the missing `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable to the GitHub Actions deploy workflow\n\n## Context\nThe Sentry Vite plugin was configured correctly but couldn't upload sourcemaps during CI builds because the authentication token wasn't available. This prevented proper error tracking and debugging in production.\n\n## Test plan\n- Ensure `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` secret is configured in GitHub repository settings\n- Deploy to production will now successfully upload sourcemaps to Sentry\n- Production errors will show proper stack traces with source code context\n\n---\n*This fix was implemented with Claude Code*",
